community-triage
================


Notes and docs for the Puppet community triage events.

These are weekly google hangouts where PRs are discussed between Puppet core team and community contributors.

There are two hangouts, one for modules and one for Puppet core. The link to the google hangouts is provided in #puppet-dev shortly before they start.


Soon, we hope to host a PR triage for the puppet-community modules.
