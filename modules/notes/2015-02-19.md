## nodejs 103

* Major rework.
* Closed all the other associated PR's.

Merged by Hunner.

daenney came in late because of browser plugin issues with BlueJeans. Minutes start from 18:18 UTC.

## stdlib 408

* This needs to be updates to work on Windows.
* L37 is weird, password is a variable but masked now by a function

## stdlib 405

Long story about base64 vs. base62 from Hunter.

* Why do we even have a `base64` version.
* What is it used for?
* We're confused about the seed.

`base64` doesn't seem useful. Leaving this for now

## apt 424

Lots of cheering.

Daenney given the honour to merge into next!

## mysql 649

This merge broke Puppetlabs internal CI. Travis is on rotation to fix this.

## tomcat 76

* This needs to be squashed
* Too many different ways of casing variables
* A lot of parameters instead of a hash with optional keys
* Only documentation on some of the classes

\_morgan will look at this further and respond. Travis will help because he has *zomg* Tomcat experience. Even on Windows.

## tomcat 74

* Needs a README
* Needs tests
* Trailing comma's

\_morgan comments.

## tomcat 70

`ensure_resource` freaks out people. But this seems to be one of the rare cases where it is correctly being used.
