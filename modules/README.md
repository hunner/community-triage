# Modules

The Puppetlabs Module Team meets in a video chat every Thursday at 18:00:00 UTC to discuss PR's against the different modules.

The URL to join the conference is posted to IRC shortly before we begin.

Module Team members and community contributors are encouraged to regularly participate. Minutes of the meetings will be kept in the `notes/` directory going forward.
