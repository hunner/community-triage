## Held Over
### Facter

[798](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/798) - [FACT-719](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-719) Fix invalid argument warning when reading dmi data
  - **Action**: 10/07 - kylog waiting on contributor and will move forward
  - 10/15 - kylog to explore this (may have exposed a GCE-related fix up)

  - this matches what wikipedia mentions is how to detect link local
  - mikaelsmith adding a cfact ticket to follow up

  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor for new tests versus changing existing tests.
  - 10/07 - ferventcoder pinged contributor, contributor is on vacation for a couple of weeks (noted in JIRA ticket)

[778](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/778) - [FACT-698](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-698) Add fips_enabled fact
  - Josh adding notes to this PR and related PUP-3114 PR at 3044
  - Uncertain of the value of the fact if we don't intend to merge PUP-3114
  - Pinged Nick F on PUP-3114 for addressing this in docs
  - 10/01 - still believe this is a documentation issue for explicit. If we fix the doc in Puppet, not sure if this is something to move forward on with facter.
  - 10/07 - NO REVIEW
  - 10/15 - ferventcoder pinged NickF/Joshcooper on the ticket about whether a decision has been made

### Hiera

[209](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera/pull/209) - (maint) use a more recent version of beaker
  - when ready to merge, we'll want to watch the tests knowing this just went in
  - we may want to prefer an even more recent version of beaker
  - **Action**: 10/01 - holding on this for now, will evaluate again later
  - 10/07 - NO REVIEW

### Puppet

[3005](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3005): [PUP-2289](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2289) Fix host type and provider
  - 10/15 - kylog mentioned operators need cleaned up
  - 10/15 - joshcooper mentioned types of errors you should expect
  - would this be able to handle other issues? lmello - it handles incomplete entries and new line in resource attributes. If it doesn't understand a line it will treat it as text.
  - lmello - should send warnings when it finds incomplete lines? ferventcoder leans towards debug messages, kylog, hlindberg lean 50/50 on this - it's a bit of a gray area - it depends on if Puppet handles it gracefully
  - **Action**: 10/15 - lmello to fix up

[3165](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3165) - [PUP-1077](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1077) Remove Nagios from core
  - daenney was curious where this was and if there was anything to do
  - kylog said we are about a week or two out on this - working on logistics
  - **Action**: 10/22 - holding while we work out logistics

[3175](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3175) - [PUP-3462](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3462) Hiera scope: add the key 'calling_class_path'
  - this is with windows not being able to use ':' as part of the filename
  - 10/15 - kylog retargeting to 4.0
  - 10/15 - ferventcoder to take for followup
  - 10/22 - ferventcoder is +1 for Windows
  - 10/22 - comments on PR, waiting for author

[3124](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3124) - [PUP-3346](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3446) Don't allow insecure SSL connections w/curl
  - ffrank noted that the `-k` is there from the beginning of time when this provider was added
  - **Action**: 10/15 - kylog left a note on ticket asking if this would be an issue specifically with OS X as it appears this is what this addresses

[3145](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3145): [PUP-3341](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3341) - Puppet apply breaks when an ENC returns an environment
  - This is similar to 3144 (includes commits from 3144), so could come after
  - ffrank: This is a bit more invasive, could override what ENC would tell a node to do
  - joshcooper: https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/3910 is the behavior we added in 3.x
  - ffrank: Shouldn't puppet apply exclusively look local?
  - should apply option have option to override environments?
  - zaphod42: we've been using the general rule that if it is specified on command line, it should take precedence.
  - kylog: what if they disagree (both manifest and an ENC)?
  - zaphod42: command line versus config can be discerned, just not yet sure if it can be discerned at the right point
  - Holding on this for now while we evaluate more of the implications - Let's start a puppet-dev thread
  - 10/05 - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/puppet-dev/l5CnnSvOpW0/3cl-kzaacJQJ (@ffrank to start thread)
  - 10/07 - Closed by ffrank to retarget to master
  - **Action**: 10/07 - ffrank retargeting against master
  - 10/15 - discussion is still pending

[3107](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3107) - [PUP-3319](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3319) - Retry send report if connection to master fails
  - sets a limit of 4 tries, but adds a retries parameter
  - zaphod42: this may catch system exit as well. That can be fixed.
  - zaphod42: it would be good to have a test, so if report does fail
  - much discussion and looking at removed retryaction.rb.
  - we'd want to clean this up and bring it back in as retry_action.rb
  - add blocks that could be passed to retry_action.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - We are going to fix up retryaction and then reevaluate this PR.
  - 10/07 - NO REVEW - Holding on this until we have retryaction updated.

[3027](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3027): [PUP-3232](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3232) Prevent group duplication when group list created from multiple sources
  - Need JIRA ticket, and some sort of tests
  - As of 9/10, Kylo to notify contributor
  - Specs and ticket added, but specs failing
  - 10/01 - followup next meeting (skipped)
  - **Action**: 10/07 - kylog to take this and fixup
  - 10/15 - kylog to look at this week

[2649](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2649): Add slot support for portage package provider.
  - Duplicates GH-2779, decision is to ping both contributors to see if they can coalesce their individual PRs into a single branch. Finch commenting this week.
  - GH-2779 hasn't seen updates, closing that one in favor of this one. There's some concern about possibly using `:` as a special value in package resource titles but we don't want to go down that route.
  - Pinged Adrien for a final call on this now that the specs are updated
  - Ethan to look at next week at some point
  - As of 9/3, Kylo asking contributor for a ticket, will revisit next week
  - As of 9/10, Kylo following up on following up
  - 9/30 - Kylo pinged contributor for ticket.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor
  - 10/07 - NO REVIEW
  - 10/15 - NO REVIEW

[2770](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2770): [PUP-1537](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1537) Allow version and held states of a package to specified as separate properties
  - This is a very big and sticky issue, and might be worth promoting into the platform team because of the wide ranging ramifications
  - Plan is to discuss how we promote issues like this, and respond to the contributor with our next steps forward
  - Pending contributor response, willing to wait on this since we're asking a lot of the contributor
  - Will need to talk with Adrien tomorrow and figure out how to hand this off.
  - Didn't have time to look at on 8/27 -- major PR that has breaking changes and could require work.  Would need to be targeted at Puppet 4 at the very least, but this one is tricky.  Will try to investigate at next PR meeting.
  - As of 9/3, punting this one a week, since it's a BIG change
  - As of 9/10, probably punting to post-PuppetConf - too big for now
  - **Action**: 10/01 - This needs a ticket number and should probably be one of the workshopped PRs kylog had mentioned in his email on triages. That way we could concentrate on this one. The commits would need fixed up to include ticket number
  - 10/07 - ferventcoder pinged contributor about failing specs

  - Check in with Adrien tomorrow 8/14 about picking this up now that he's rotated off of community role
