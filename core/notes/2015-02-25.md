## Reviewed and Updated this Week

Note: we'll be adding Puppet Server community PRs to the meeting starting soon (possibly next week). Justin May will be leading this effort.

### Puppet

Due to the current PR merge freeze while Puppet 4.0.0 is being released, PRs without new actions will remain on hold until the merge freeze is over. PRs tagged with "Merge After Unfreeze" should be ready for merge as-is and don't require further review.
