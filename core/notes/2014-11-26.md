## New

We decided to use the github issue tracking system instead of using separate notes. From now on there will be a "Notes from triage" in the PR. PRs that have been triaged (are in flight) are now labeled with "Triaged" at github.

The following tickets were triaged during this triage:

[Open](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fpuppet+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Ffacter+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fhiera+is%3Apr+label%3ATriaged+updated%3A%222014-11-26+..+2014-12-02%22+is%3Aopen+)<br>
[Closed](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fpuppet+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Ffacter+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fhiera+is%3Apr+label%3ATriaged+updated%3A%222014-11-26+..+2014-12-02%22+is%3Aclosed)
