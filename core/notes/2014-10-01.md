## New:

### Hiera

[208](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera/pull/208) - (maint) inform which key caused type mismatch
  - looks good - commit message needs fixed up
  - **Action**: 10/01 - ferventcoder to do

[213](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera/pull/213) - [HI-183](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/HI-183) - Support complex value lookups
  - this is only additive
  - **Action**: 10/01 - ferventcoder to look at this sprint

[209](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera/pull/209) - (maint) use a more recent version of beaker
  - when ready to merge, we'll want to watch the tests knowing this just went in
  - we may want to prefer an even more recent version of beaker
  - **Action**: 10/01 - holding on this for now, will evaluate again later

### Facter

[787](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/787) - [FACT-706](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-706) - Fixing xenstore-read errors
  - looks good, pulling in
  - **Action**: Merged by whopper on 10/01

[786](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/786) - [FACT-680](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-680)
  - this matches what wikipedia mentions is how to detect link local
  - mikaelsmith adding a cfact ticket to follow up
  - This looks pretty good
  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor for new tests versus changing existing tests.

### Puppet:

[3144](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3144): [PUP-3258](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3258) - Fix ENC issue with puppet apply
  - **Action**: 10/01 - zaphod42 to evaluate. Pulling into this upcoming sprint

[3145](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3145): [PUP-3341](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3341) - Puppet apply breaks when an ENC returns an environment
  - This is similar to 3144 (includes commits from 3144), so could come after
  - ffrank: This is a bit more invasive, could override what ENC would tell a node to do
  - joshcooper: https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/3910 is the behavior we added in 3.x
  - ffrank: Shouldn't puppet apply exclusively look local?
  - should apply option have option to override environments?
  - zaphod42: we've been using the general rule that if it is specified on command line, it should take precedence.
  - kylog: what if they disagree (both manifest and an ENC)?
  - zaphod42: command line versus config can be discerned, just not yet sure if it can be discerned at the right point
  - **Action**: Holding on this for now while we evaluate more of the implications - Let's start a puppet-dev thread
  - **Action**: 10/01 - FIXME WITH LINK (@ffrank to start thread)

[3127](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3127) - [PUP-3355](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3355) - Remove pson document type
  - joshcooper: I believe it is backwards compatible
  - **Action**: 10/01 - Pulling into the next sprint

[3112](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3112) - [PUP-3331](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3331) - Provide auto* relationships for types
  - zaphod42: initial reaction on [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/puppet-dev/eU2qTb6kDn0/oYfkKWfn-gkJ)
  - kylog will move it forward once specs are in
  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor for specs

[3107](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3107) - [PUP-3319](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3319) - Retry send report if connection to master fails
  - sets a limit of 4 tries, but adds a retries parameter
  - zaphod42: this may catch system exit as well. That can be fixed.
  - zaphod42: it would be good to have a test, so if report does fail
  - much discussion and looking at removed retryaction.rb.
  - we'd want to clean this up and bring it back in as retry_action.rb
  - add blocks that could be passed to retry_action.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - We are going to fix up retryaction and then reevaluate this PR.

## Held Over

### Facter:

[777](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/777): FACT-695 Return correct data types
  - Putting on hold until 10/01 for additional discussion
  - 10/1 - dalen: should this be part of Facter 3?
  - **Action**: 10/01 - Kylo to scrub through and move forward week of 10/01.

[778](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter/pull/778): FACT-698 Add fips_enabled fact
  - Josh adding notes to this PR and related PUP-3114 PR at 3044
  - Uncertain of the value of the fact if we don't intend to merge PUP-3114
  - Pinged Nick F on PUP-3114 for addressing this in docs
  - **Action**: 10/01 - still believe this is a documentation issue for explicit. If we fix the doc in Puppet, not sure if this is something to move forward on with facter.

### Puppet:

[3027](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3027): [PUP-3232](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3232) Prevent group duplication when group list created from multiple sources
  - Need JIRA ticket, and some sort of tests
  - As of 9/10, Kylo to notify contributor
  - Specs and ticket added, but specs failing
  - **Action**: 10/01 - followup next meeting (skipped)

[2919](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2919): [PUP-2995](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2995) Proposal for processing an external trusted OID yaml file
  - JIRA issue has been filed for this pull request
  - Needs spec tests, needs refining of the implementation. We'll continue work on this with the contributor.
  - Check in with Adrien tomorrow 8/14 about picking this up now that he's rotated off of community role
  - JoshP to check in on the settings behavior, given we don't want to use a class variable to track init state (and have several different hook options available for determining when settings can be changed)
  - As of 9/3, Ethan asked for contributor clarification on implementation
  - As of 9/10, much discussion on this particular issue -- we're uncertain of the lifecycle implications. Adrien suggested an alternative to hooks, and JoshC had some feedback on code.
  - 9/30 Kylo pinged contributor.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor

[2649](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2649): Add slot support for portage package provider.
  - Duplicates GH-2779, decision is to ping both contributors to see if they can coalesce their individual PRs into a single branch. Finch commenting this week.
  - GH-2779 hasn't seen updates, closing that one in favor of this one. There's some concern about possibly using `:` as a special value in package resource titles but we don't want to go down that route.
  - Pinged Adrien for a final call on this now that the specs are updated
  - Ethan to look at next week at some point
  - As of 9/3, Kylo asking contributor for a ticket, will revisit next week
  - As of 9/10, Kylo following up on following up
  - 9/30 Kylo pinged contributor for ticket.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - waiting on contributor

[2770](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2770): [PUP-1537](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1537) Allow version and held states of a package to specified as separate properties
  - This is a very big and sticky issue, and might be worth promoting into the platform team because of the wide ranging ramifications
  - Plan is to discuss how we promote issues like this, and respond to the contributor with our next steps forward
  - Pending contributor response, willing to wait on this since we're asking a lot of the contributor
  - Will need to talk with Adrien tomorrow and figure out how to hand this off.
  - Didn't have time to look at on 8/27 -- major PR that has breaking changes and could require work.  Would need to be targeted at Puppet 4 at the very least, but this one is tricky.  Will try to investigate at next PR meeting.
  - As of 9/3, punting this one a week, since it's a BIG change
  - As of 9/10, probably punting to post-PuppetConf - too big for now
  - **Action**: 10/01 - This needs a ticket number and should probably be one of the workshopped PRs kylog had mentioned in his email on triages. That way we could concentrate on this one.
