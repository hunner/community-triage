## New

We decided to use the github issue tracking system instead of using separate notes. From now on there will be a "Notes from triage" in the PR. PRs that have been triaged (are in flight) are now labeled with "Triaged" at github.

The following tickets were triaged:

[Open](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fpuppet+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Ffacter+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fhiera+is%3Apr+label%3ATriaged+updated%3A%222014-11-19+..+2014-11-25%22+is%3Aopen+)<br>
[Closed](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fpuppet+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Ffacter+repo%3Apuppetlabs%2Fhiera+is%3Apr+label%3ATriaged+updated%3A%222014-11-19+..+2014-11-25%22+is%3Aclosed)

[3238](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3238) - [PUP-3547](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3547) File Server Mounts Should Support Directory Environments
  - this adds the ability to have different mount points for every environment
  - 10/29 - ffrank asked contributor whether there was a workaround for pseudo-modules?
  - ferventcoder asked if this opens a possible security issue due to %e opening up possible elevation. zaphod42 mentions this doesn't open any issues that were not already there.
  - zaphod42 states we already have a way - you create a module with your environment files. ffrank mentioned this earlier as well
  - ferventcoder mentions possible big files and git, even though user is not restricted to using git for a repo
  - zaphod42 states that this could be done now with just putting your files in a data module. And modules is where we should be going with this.
  - ffrank mentions this could be done as a sort of enhancement for r10k (like symlinks to local directories posing as modules)
  - ferventcoder pinged adrienthebo on r10k capabilities (it does support svn)
  - **Action**: 10/29 - ffrank commented on the ticket and we are waiting to see what need the contributor has for this.
  - 11/05 - Discussions: Suggest using plugin sync (issue with plugin sync and environments being fixed in 3.7.4)? Problem is that file server has no notion of environment what so ever. Questionable if the suggested fix in the PR is better than other available workarounds.
  - **Action**: 11/05 - if security is an issue many more changes are required, and if security is not an issue then other suggested work arounds are just as good. ffrank to comment on PR.

[3219](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3219) - [PUP-3481](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3481) A more forgiving regexp for parse_selinux_context()
  - 10/22, change relaxes the rule for matching quite extensively - what are the rules for the format?
  - **Action**: 10/22 - kylog - ask if there is a specification.
  - 10/29 - NO REVIEW
  - 11/01 - Contributor responded
  - 11/5 - zaphod42, there is no actual specification, so relaxing the regexp is reasonable.
  - **Action** 11/05 - finch to merge
  - 11/05 - finch left comments for author, waiting on contributor
 
[3107](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3107) - [PUP-3319](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3319) - Retry send report if connection to master fails
  - sets a limit of 4 tries, but adds a retries parameter
  - zaphod42: this may catch system exit as well. That can be fixed.
  - zaphod42: it would be good to have a test, so if report does fail
  - much discussion and looking at removed retryaction.rb.
  - we'd want to clean this up and bring it back in as retry_action.rb
  - add blocks that could be passed to retry_action.
  - **Action**: 10/01 - We are going to fix up retryaction and then reevaluate this PR.
  - 10/07 - NO REVEW - Holding on this until we have retryaction updated.
  - 10/29 - NO REVIEW
  - 11/05 - blocked on PUP-3379, retryaction still hasn't been added back
  - 11/12 - blocked on PUP-3379, retryaction still hasn't been added back
